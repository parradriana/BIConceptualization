# BI Conceptualization
This repository is one of many exercices of dimensional modeling, applying Kimball concepts, we built at Bois de Boulogne (where I did my Specialization in BI and Big Data), at least one I remember very well :)
It is the staging phase of a BI solution.  We identified the busines needs and responded to somme questions from our client, the owner of a carwash and no, 
he was not Walter Whtite (breaking bad joke).

I had the collaboration of my teamwork Helen and Hanane, hope I find their githubs profiles.
The ERD was designed with VisualParadigme and all documentation of our job (beside the SQL queries) is in French language, so, profitez-en and if you have any questions you can send me a message.

Thanks, merci
